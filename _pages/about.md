Hello! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Information Science department at Cornell University, advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/michaelmacy14/welcome-to-michael-macys-website">Prof. Michael Macy</a>. Previously, I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia (UBC), under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~laks/">Prof. Laks V.S. Lakshmanan</a>. Before that, I got my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering with a minor in Mathematics from Sharif University of Technology.
